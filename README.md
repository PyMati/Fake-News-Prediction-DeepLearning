# Fake News Detection using PyTorch

## Introduction

This repository contains code for a Fake News Detection system implemented in PyTorch. The primary objective is to classify news articles as either fake or real based on their content. The model leverages a TF-IDF vectorizer and a neural network for classification, with the dataset sourced from a CSV file named `news.csv`.
